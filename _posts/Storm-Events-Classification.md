## Storm Events Classification

<!-- App simple predictor -->

Predicting damages or injures caused by a severe event is a key part of [risk modeling software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophe_modeling).
The [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAZUS) 
calculates [financial impacts of catastrophes before they occur](http://www.air-worldwide.com/Models/About-Catastrophe-Modeling/).
Typically, the input consists of an event generation and exposure data. 
Physical damage is then estimated for each affected exposure.
Insured loss is evaluated based on policy conditions and the damage estimation.



Currently, several risk '..' software packages exist that 
predict probability of a storm event as well as damages caused by such an event.

Our goal here is to run a simple analysis on the publicly available [datasets]
of storm events and predict property damage and injuries caused by a 
given storm type if additional information is known, such as state,
season, ...


Storm categories are characterized by EVENT_TYPE feature in the NOAA datasets. 
A closer look at the datasets reveals that many different EVENT_TYPEs are used, including descriptions such as .. vs. ...
In order to categorize storms, we decide to bin the different events into eight 
categories: Storm, Wind, ...

Note:

NOAA has publicly available [datasets]()
on storm events.
The data is collected from various sources, including ...
