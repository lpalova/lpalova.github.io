Created a demo app (currently not active) on AWS of my [scientific publications search engine](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CeH6sUAkqVQmRL3qRiiW-RTbA3sPCZrlAuIMxgwM5f4/edit#slide=id.g1378c875a2_0_0)
that uses [latent semantic indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis) 
and [PageRank algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)
to recommend papers in the condensed-matter materials-science subfield.
