*Work in progress*

[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a simple tool for modelling the relationship 
between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables, where this relationship is expressed as
a linear function of the explanatory variables. 
If the [model assumptions](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-multiple-linear-regression/)
are met, it can predict an increase or decrease in the dependent variable based on the changes in the explanatory variables; e.g., for each $1 that I invest into the production budget of my future movie, how much will I earn on the movie's total gross? 
Answering a question like this is not an easy task. Naturally, we would ask the following questions: (i) What is the prediction power of our model? 
(ii) Can we trust the model's linear coefficients?
(iii) What features do we include/omit in our analysis? Could we perform any better, and if so, how does the final model look like?

[Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
is a great resource for movie industry data. The website is neatly organized, allowing one to extract different features about each movie, such as domestic total gross, production budget, release date, widest release theaters count, genre, runtime, rating of the movie, as well as information on the distributor, director, producer(s), actor(s), screenwriter(s), composer(s), cinematographer(s), etc. 
Because we are interested in answering our question of interest, that is, how much will I earn on a movie's (domestic) total gross if I invest $1 in its production budget, 
our dependent variable will be domestic total gross.
