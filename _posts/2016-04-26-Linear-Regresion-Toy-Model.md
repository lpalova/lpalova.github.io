*Work in progress*

[Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is a simple tool for modelling the relationship 
between a scalar dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables where this relationship is expressed as
a linear function of the explanatory variables. 
If the [model assumptions](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/assumptions-of-multiple-linear-regression/)
are met, it can predict the increase or decrease in the dependent variable based on the changes in the explanatory variables, e.g. for each $1 that I invest into the production budget of my future movie, how much will I earn on the movie's total gross? 


[Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
is a great resource of movie industry data. The website is neatly organized, allowing us to extract data, such as domestic total gross, production budget, release date, widest release theaters count, genre, runtime, rating of the movie, as well as information on the distributor, director, producer(s), actor(s), screenwriter(s), composer(s), cinematographer(s), etc. 
Here I look at the effects of various features on the domestic total gross of a movie, with the goal to predict the domestic total gross using a linear regression. The prediction power of the algorithm is low, ...
