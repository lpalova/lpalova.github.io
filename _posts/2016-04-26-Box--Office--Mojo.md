*Work in progress*

[Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
is a great resource of movie industry data. The website is neatly organized, allowing us to extract data, such as domestic total gross, production budget, release date, widest release theaters count, genre, runtime, rating of the movie, as well as information on the distributor, director, producer(s), actor(s), screenwriter(s), composer(s), cinematographer(s), etc.
