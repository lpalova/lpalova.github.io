I am a trained physicist with a Ph.D. (2010) from Rutgers. I have worked in computational and theoretical physics. 
As a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, I modeled nanomaterials using software simulation packages.
<!-- I collaborated with other scientists, presented at conferences and published my work in top peer-reviewed journals.-->

I am well versed in basic statistical and data manipulation methods. I am currently a data scientist at Metis (Spring 2016). I got certified in data science specialization by John Hopkins University on Coursera (2015). Samples of my work are available on github: https://github.com/lpalova
I am fluent in R, Python and familiar with Java, Git/Github, Unix commands, Shiny, Slidify, RStudio, office/presentation software, SQL and basics of Spark.
I have a passion for the field of education. I have been teaching physics, chemistry and math classes and worked with talented high school students since 2001. As a faculty at NJIT, I teach undergraduate math, financial math and statistics. I have full responsibility for managing and running my classes. I am in charge of creating syllabi, exam questions and teaching materials, grading, and working with classroom presentation equipment.
I am looking for a contract or contract to permanent job opportunities in data science or a related field. I love analyzing, helping creating new products and tools, writing reports. I am an independent thinker and a quick learner. Areas of my interests include technology, education, energy, healthcare and more.
