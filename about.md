I am a trained physicist with a Ph.D. from [Rutgers University](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/). I worked in computational and theoretical physics. As a postdoctoral researcher at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/), I modeled [nanomaterials](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/999.abstract) using software [simulation](https://www.vasp.at/) [packages](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/). I collaborated with other scientists, presented at conferences and published results of my work in top peer-reviewed journals.

I have a passion for education. I have been teaching physics, chemistry and math classes at regular, advanced and honors levels, and worked with talented high school students since 2001. As a faculty at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/), I taught undergraduate calculus, financial math and statistics.

Recently, I've got involved in data science work. Please check my projects [here](http://lpalova.github.io/), or 
[here](https://github.com/lpalova). I work with data, use visualization, predictive modeling, machine learning, cloud computing (e.g., [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)).
I know [R](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/LL4BR8M6KAGX), 
[Python](http://www.thisismetis.com/), 
[SQL](https://prod-cert-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/887f1902d7c941cda709f846f642f8e8/Statement.pdf).

I am open to new opportunities in teaching, data analysis, or research. 
I am an independent thinker, quick learner, continuously learning new ideas through many meetups and conferences.
Areas of my interests include education, technology and research, green energy, and more.
