I am a trained physicist with a Ph.D. from [Rutgers University](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/). I worked in computational and theoretical physics. As a postdoctoral researcher at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/), I modeled [nanomaterials](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/999.abstract) using software [simulation](https://www.vasp.at/) [packages](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/). I collaborated with other scientists, presented at conferences and published results of my work in top peer-reviewed journals. I have a passion for education. I have been teaching physics, chemistry and math classes and worked with talented high school students since 2001. As a faculty at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/), I taught undergraduate calculus, financial math and statistics.

I am well versed in statistical and data manipulation methods. Recently, I got certified in data science specialization by John Hopkins University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/LL4BR8M6KAGX), and completed a data science bootcamp at [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/). I am proficient in Python, R and SQL. Samples of my work are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lpalova).

I am looking for job opportunities in data science or data analysis. I am an independent thinker and a quick learner, can get stuff done. Areas of my interests include technology, education.
