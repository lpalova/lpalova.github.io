I am a trained physicist with a Ph.D. (2010) from [Rutgers](http://www.rutgers.edu/). I have worked in computational and theoretical physics. 
As a postdoctoral researcher at [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/), I modeled nanomaterials using software simulation packages.
<!-- I collaborated with other scientists, presented at conferences and published my work in top peer-reviewed journals.-->

I am well versed in basic statistical and data manipulation methods. I am currently a data scientist at 
[Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) (Spring 2016). I got certified in data science specialization by John Hopkins University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/LL4BR8M6KAGX) (2015). Samples of my work are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lpalova).
I am fluent in R, Python and familiar with Java, Git/Github, Unix commands, Shiny, Slidify, RStudio, office/presentation software, SQL.

I have a passion for the field of education. I have been teaching physics, chemistry and math classes and worked with talented high school students since 2001. As a faculty at [NJIT](http://www.njit.edu/), I have taught undergraduate math, financial math and statistics. At [Rutgers](http://www.rutgers.edu/), I taught undergraduate physics recitations and labs. I have experience teaching high school calculus, physics and chemistry.
<!--I have full responsibility for managing and running my classes. I am in charge of creating syllabi, exam questions and teaching materials, grading, and working with classroom presentation equipment.-->

### More Information
