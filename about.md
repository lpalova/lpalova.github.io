I am a trained research physicist with a Ph.D. (2010) from Rutgers. I worked in computational and theoretical physics. 
As a graduate student at Rutgers and a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, I modeled 
[nanomaterials](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/999.abstract)
using software [simulation](https://www.vasp.at/) [packages](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/).
<!-- I collaborated with other scientists, presented at conferences and published my work in top peer-reviewed journals.-->

I am well versed in statistical and data manipulation methods. I am currently a data scientist at 
[Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) (Spring 2016). I got certified in data science specialization by John Hopkins University on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/LL4BR8M6KAGX) (2015). Samples of my work are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lpalova).
I am fluent in R, Python and familiar with Java, Git/Github, Unix commands, Shiny, Slidify, RStudio, office/presentation software, SQL.

I have a passion for the field of education. I have been teaching physics, chemistry and math classes and worked with talented high school students since 2001. I taught undergraduate math, financial math and statistics at [NJIT](http://www.njit.edu/), undergraduate physics at [Rutgers](http://www.rutgers.edu/), and I have experience teaching high school calculus, physics and chemistry.
<!--I have full responsibility for managing and running my classes. I am in charge of creating syllabi, exam questions and teaching materials, grading, and working with classroom presentation equipment.-->
